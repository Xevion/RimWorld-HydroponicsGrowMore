A simple patch mod to allow hydroponics basins to grow additional crops typically limited to the ground.

Currently, these crops are [Devilstrand][rimworld-devilstrand], [Haygrass][rimworld-haygrass], and [Corn][rimworld-corn].

This mod could be considered overpowered, but I'm adding it as other versions are outdated (but probably still work), and I wanted to add some extensions for my other mod, [Hydroponics Expanded][github-hydroponics-expanded].

## Compatability

If your mod adds hydroponics that properly designate themselves using the `ThingDef.building.sowTag` (as `Hydroponic`), then this patch should work with it.

If there are other patch mods modifying `ThingDef.building.sowTag`, then hope that they are not completely replacing the `sowTags` list. If they are, then load this mod AFTER their's.

## Usage

1. Install the mod.
    - Download from the Steam Workshop [here][workshop-hydroponics-grow-more].
    - Or download from the Releases tab [here][github-hydroponics-grow-more-release].
2. Then unzip the archive into your RimWorld mods folder.
